# Task 4 â€“ Aggregate Functions & Grouping (SQL Internship)

---
## Objective : Use **aggregate functions** (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, etc.) and **GROUP BY** in SQL to summarize and analyze data.

---
## Tools Used : **MySQL Workbench** 

---

## Table Data

* **Departments**: HR, Sales, Finance, IT
* **Employees**: 8 sample employees with department, salary, and joining date.

---

## ðŸ“œ Queries Implemented

1. `Total Salary by Department`

2. `Average Salary (Rounded`

3. `Count Employees per Department`

4. `Count Non-Null Salaries`

5. `Departments with More Than 1 Employee`

6. `Highest Salary per Department`

## Key Learnings

* **GROUP BY** helps categorize data into groups.
* **HAVING** filters groups after aggregation (unlike WHERE).
* **COUNT(\*)** counts all rows, while **COUNT(column)** ignores NULL values.
* Aggregate functions like **SUM**, **AVG**, **MAX** summarize numeric data.
* You can group by **multiple columns** for detailed categorization.
